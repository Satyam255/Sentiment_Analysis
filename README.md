## 📊 Sentiment Analysis – Vectorization Comparison

This project demonstrates how different vectorization techniques affect sentiment classification accuracy.

### 🧪 Vectorization Methods & Accuracy

| Vectorization Method | Accuracy (%) |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Bag of Words (BoW)   | 57.5         |
| TF-IDF               | 57.9         |
| Word2Vec             | **68.4**     |

### 🔍 Goal

The primary objective of this script is to compare traditional vectorization techniques (BoW and TF-IDF) with **Word2Vec**, showcasing how semantic embeddings can significantly improve model performance in sentiment analysis tasks.
